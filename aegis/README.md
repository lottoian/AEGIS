## Usage

### Command (Android)

```bash
Install AEGIS.apk on target Android device
Logs will be generated and stored in protected internal storage
Collected logs are transmitted to Remote Server (Spring Boot + MongoDB)
Forensic Analyzer reconstructs timeline and generates report
```

### AEGIS automatically records and transmits:
1. Anti-Forensic attempts (timestamp manipulation, logcat -c, reboot/shutdown)  
2. File system events (create, modify, delete)  
3. Calling activity (incoming, outgoing, duration, rejection)  
4. SMS messages (send/receive)  
5. Bluetooth connections & streaming events  
6. App execution & UI interactions  

Generated logs are integrity-protected using **SHA-256 hash values**, and uploaded logs are verified on the server before being stored.

## Precautions

This tool is designed for **forensic research and investigation purposes**.  
It requires explicit installation on the target device (no stealth mode).  
The captured data includes sensitive personal information (calls, messages, timestamps), so proper authorization and legal compliance must be ensured.  

If you are using this tool in research or open-source projects, please cite our paper in *FSI: Digital Investigation*. ; _**(Under Review)**_

## Example Report Output

Each forensic report includes:
- Event type and occurrence time  
- Original log message contents  
- Tampering detection results  
- Server-device timestamp offset  
- SHA-256 hash value for integrity verification  

---

## Comparison to Existing Tools  

AEGIS provides:
- ✅ Remote storage without ADB requirement  
- ✅ Integrity verification (SHA-256)  
- ✅ Anti-Forensic detection (logcat -c, timestamp manipulation, reboot)  
- ✅ Automated timeline reconstruction  
- ✅ Structured forensic reporting  

Other tools (e.g., DroidWatch, DELTA, LogExtractor) lack one or more of these essential features.
